This website contains some infographics I made for the game "Guardian Tales":
- Raid Recorded Runs - Top recorded runs for each raid season.
- Raid-Essential Myth Nodes - List of myth nodes that must be awakened for raid.
- World Maps - Complete map of each world in adventure mode.

This project was created to practice web development. The following concepts were applied to this website:
- Basic html structure
- Inputting images
- Linking text to other pages
- Linking text to external websites  
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox implementation

This was made possible through lessons learned The Odin Project.
