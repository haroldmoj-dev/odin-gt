# odin-gt

This project was created to practice web development. The following concepts were applied to this website:
- Basic html structure
- Inputting images
- Linking text to other pages
- Linking text to external websites  

The website itself contains different stuff about the game Guardian Tales:
- Raid Infographics  

This was made possible through lessons learned The Odin Project.
